'''
[PROJECT] Pythagorean Triples Checker

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read this article on wikipedia.

MAIN GOAL

Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle,
and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.

SUBGOALS

If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order,
change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order.
Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.
Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.

play = True

while play:
    s1 = int(input("Enter Side 1: "))
    s2 = int(input("Enter Side 2: "))
    s3 = int(input("Enter Side 3: "))
    c1 = s1 ** 2 + s2 ** 2 == s3 ** 2
    c2 = s1 ** 2 + s3 ** 2 == s2 ** 2
    c3 = s2 ** 2 + s3 ** 2 == s1 ** 2
    if c1 or c2 or c3:
        print("This is a Pythagorean triple!")
    else:
        print("This is NOT a Pythagorean triple : (")
    num = input("Type 0 to quit or anything else to play again: ")
    if num == "0":
        play = False
print()
print("Thanks for playing!")
